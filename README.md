# What is grok

Grok is a great way to parse unstructured log data into something structured and queryable. It sits on top of Regular Expression (regex) and uses text patterns to match lines in log files.

A great way to get started with building yours grok filters is this grok debug tool: https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/

What can I use Grok for?
 - reporting errors and other patterns from logs and processes
 - parsing complex text output and converting it to json for external processing
 - apply 'write-once use-everywhere' to regular expressions
 - automatically providing patterns for unknown text inputs (logs you want patterns generated for future matching)

The syntax for a grok pattern is `%{SYNTAX:SEMANTIC}`

The `SYNTAX` is the name of [the pattern][3] that will match your text. `SEMANTIC` is the key. 

For example, `3.44` will be matched by the `NUMBER` pattern and `55.3.244.1` will be matched by the `IP` pattern. `3.44` could be the duration of an event, so you could call it simply `duration`. Further, a string `55.3.244.1` might identify the `client` making a request.
For the above example, your grok filter would look something like this:

```
%{NUMBER:duration} %{IP:client}
```
Examples: With that idea of a syntax and semantic, we can pull out useful fields from a sample log like this fictional http request log:

```
55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043
```
The pattern for this could be:

```
%{IP:client} %{WORD:method} %{URIPATHPARAM:request} %{NUMBER:bytes} %{NUMBER:duration}
```
